#### 1.1 Brief Description


This use case allows the user if there are valid moves (after rolling the dice) to move his pawn to the highlighted position. If the user wants to move it to unvalid field, the game will notify him and wait for his correct move. The pawn placed in the valid field is relevant colored and all the buttons are disabled so that the next player can perform his next turn.
